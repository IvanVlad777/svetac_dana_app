# svetac_dana_app
My idea of a little app for description of each saint in calendar. (in Croatian lang)

This is app that show Saint for current day according to Catholic calendar with some croatian specifics.

I made this application for parish "Uzvišenje svetog Križa", Zagreb - Siget after i graduated theology in 2019.

Descriptions of saints are in croatina language and author of text is fra Rajko Gelemanović from his book "Sa svecem svakoga dana".
